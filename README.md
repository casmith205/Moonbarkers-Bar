# Moon Barkers
This is the code repository for Moon Barkers. This is a work in progress. A little about Moon Barkers... Big dreams, big results. Come drink taps from the Minnesota grown breweries and distilleries that you know and love. 100 % of profits (we do have to pay back debt, for more information on finances, check out these spreadsheets) will go to funding Cooper’s Kennel – a non-profit shelter trying to change the adoption game. Cooper’s Kennel is an on-site shelter, but if dogs aren’t your thing, just come for the beer! Our facilities are completely separate, so bring your own furry bff (or just regular bff, your call), check out the shelter while you’re here, or don’t! This is a bar for everyone. Whoever you bring, you both can feel good about your beer because you are helping man’s best friend. So, drink up!
